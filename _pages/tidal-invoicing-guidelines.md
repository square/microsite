# Thanks so much for your contribution to TIDAL!

## Where and How to Submit Your Invoice:

1. Submit your completed invoice, in PDF format, directly to incoming@tidal.com
2. If it is not in a PDF format, it will be rejected by the system.
3. Be sure to CC TIDAL employee that assigned you the work/project (when applicable)


## What To Include on Your Invoice:

1. PO Number
2. The correct TIDAL entity from the PO. It will be one of the following:
  1. TIDAL Music AS
  2. Aspiro AB
  3. Project Panther US LLC
3. Date of submission (the date on your invoice should match the day you send it in)
4. Date of services
5. Your Name
6. Your Address
7. Unique invoice number
8. E-mail address
9. Your bank’s name
10. Your bank’s address
11. Your account name (how it appears on your account)
12. Your account number/IBAN number
13. Wire routing number/Swift code
14. A description of your goods / services

## Additional Guidance:

If the name you’re billing under is different from the name you are known by, please make that clear in your invoice. For example, if we know your DJ/artist name, but the payment is going to your personal bank account with your proper name, we need to know. The same goes for if you’re invoicing through a business (LLC, etc).

## Please note that we cannot accept/process invoices received through Quickbooks.

Please do not submit your invoice more than once (unless instructed to). If duplicate invoices are entered into the system, it will delay payment processing.

Please note that “Incoming” is not a person, it is an automated account & will not reply to messages! Any questions please send to [link](ap@tidal.com)

Thanks for your cooperation!
