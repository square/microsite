# Thanks so much for your contribution to TIDAL!

## TIDAL Invoicing Via Tradeshift:

TIDAL invoicing has transitioned to Tradeshift for touchless processing of our invoices. Tradeshift, our free, e-invoicing platform, speeds up the delivery of your invoices to us to help you get paid on time. It also provides enhanced security while giving you greater visibility into invoice statuses. 

Tradeshift will be the **only** way you can submit invoices. Once you follow the basic steps in your Tradeshift Invite, the system will guide you through the set up process. 

### Can’t find the official Tradeshift Invite sent from [Supplierinvitation@tradeshift.com](Supplierinvitation@tradeshift.com)?

Please check your junk or spam folder if it’s not in your primary inbox, or [Contact Block, Inc. here](http://go.workwithsquare.com/NDI0LUlBQi0yMTgAAAGPIO5EmIZtMssxKQ68gcxgBVI99ne402xxb0xVEhrro91dT8HVNT0W8Jhxv4bJIIuJfb14MMQ=) if you have any questions or need to request an invite to Tradeshift.

## Additional Guidance:

If the name you’re billing under is different from the name you are known by, please make that clear in your invoice. For example, if we know your DJ/artist name, but the payment is going to your personal bank account with your proper name, we need to know. The same goes for if you’re invoicing through a business (LLC, etc).

## Please note that we cannot accept/process invoices received through Quickbooks.

Please do not submit your invoice more than once (unless instructed to). If duplicate invoices are entered into the system, it will delay payment processing.

Any questions related to invoices and payments, **Block’s dedicated Helpdesk** is readily available to assist you.
